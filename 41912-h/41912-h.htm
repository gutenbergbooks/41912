<p>The following modest recital of a life which has covered
much of the most interesting period of pioneering in this part of
the country is of the greatest interest and value to all who know
and love the Northwest. Few lives have been so full of such
varied experiences and the clear and poignant recital of the
massacre at Waillatpu is of the greatest historical importance.
It is so vividly told that it should carry its own convincing truth
down the years, as the basis of all writing in connection with the
labors of that splendid type of missionaries, Dr. and Mrs.
Whitman.</p>

<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>The thought of fostering care seems to have remained with
this "survivor" since her days with the Whitmans.</p>

<p>Forgiving innocent ones for the atrocious acts of their kindred
upon her own brothers, Mrs. Delaney became a benefactor
of the Indians. Before the apportionment of their lands the
Coeur d'Alene squaws and children suffered great hardships.
To them the Farmington hotel kitchen was a haven of warmth
and plenty. They started home cheered and fed with bundles
of food to tie on their ponies. The Delaney living room is the
only place I have seen Indian women and girls light hearted
and chatty. They loved to linger to sing for their hostess. Mrs.
Delaney's hospitality extended to clergymen of all creeds. Her's
has been a life of hard but generous service. "Not to be ministered
unto but to minister" seems to have been the life motto
of this woman reared in the wilds.</p>

<p>In 1881 General and Mrs. T. R. Tannatt came to the Northwest
when the latter began a search for historical data; she
sought pioneers and recorded their statements for comparison,
in an effort to obtain truth. Opportunity gave her acquaintance
with Mr. Gray, author of History of Oregon, Rev. Cushing Eels,
the Spalding family, several survivors of the Whitman massacre,
and pioneer army and railway officers from whom she
gleaned information which later assisted her in writing the
booklet, "Indian Battles of the Inland Empire in 1858," published
by the D. A. R.</p>

<p>In 1887 she stopped at the Farmington hotel owned by Mrs.
Delaney, and continued an acquaintance with her until 1920. She
said Mrs. Delaney's account of the massacre never varied, and in
discussion of points of difference with other survivors Mrs. Delaney's
clear description and logical reasoning invariably convinced
the others that she must be correct, while her clear remembrance
of subsequent events, known to them both for more than
three decades, strengthened Mrs. Tannatt's belief in the accuracy
of her earlier impressions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tannatt often urged this witness of the heartrending
tragedy to publish her recollections, and had the pleasure of reading
the manuscript for this narrative which she said contained
the most comprehensive and truthful description of the Whitman
massacre she had seen. She consented to write the Foreword,
but before doing so was summoned by her Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1844 we started to make the journey across
the plains with ox teams. I was born in 1839, October 16th, near
St. Joseph, Mo., which was a very small town on the extreme
frontier, right on the Missouri River, with just a few houses.
My father's name was Henry Sager. He moved from Virginia
to Ohio, then to Indiana and from there to Missouri. My mother's
name was Naomi Carney-Sager. In the month of April, 1844, my
father got the Oregon fever and we started West for the Oregon
Territory. Our teams were oxen and for the start we went to
Independence, the rendezvous where the companies were made
up to come across the plains. There were six children then&mdash;one
was born on the journey, making seven in all.</p>

<p>The men of the company organized in a military manner,
having their captain and other officers, for they were going
through the Indian country and guards had to be put out for the
protection of the travellers and to herd the stock. The immigration
of '43 was piloted through by Dr. Whitman and ours was the
second immigration across the mountains. The road was only
a trail and was all Indian territory at that time, from the Missouri
River to the Rocky Mountains. We had to ferry streams, sometimes
with canoes fastened together and the wagons put on them;
and the Indians rowed us across the rivers in some places. The
mountains were steep and sometimes we had to unyoke our cattle
and drive them down, letting the wagons down by ropes. The
Captain of our company was named William Shaw. There were
vast herds of buffalo on the plains and wandering bands of
Indians. We had to guard the cattle at night by taking turns.
After we started across the plains we traveled slowly; and one
day in getting out of the wagon my oldest sister caught her dress
and her leg was broken by the wheel running over it. There was
no doctor in our company, but there was a German doctor by
the name of Dagan in the following company and he and my
father fixed up the leg and from that time on the old doctor
stayed with us and helped. My father was taken sick with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">Eight</a></span>
mountain fever and he finally died and was buried on the banks
of the Green River in Wyoming. His last request was that
Captain Shaw take charge of us and see us safe through to the
Whitman station. He thought that was as far as we could go
that winter. Twenty-six days later my mother died. She made
the same request of Captain Shaw and called us around her
and told my brothers to always stay with us and keep us together&mdash;meaning
the girls of the family. Dr. Dagan came on and helped
to care for us with the boys' help. When my mother died, my
injured sister could walk only with the help of a crutch. Mother
was wrapped in a blanket and buried by the side of the road.
So the Captain and his wife looked after us and the other immigrants
showed their concern for the orphans by taking an interest
in us. A kind woman, Mrs. Eads, took the tiny baby and the
big-hearted travelers shared their last piece of bread with us.
We finally arrived at Dr. Whitman's station on the 17th day
of October, 1844, seven months from the Missouri River to the
Whitman station. It was a long time!</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitman wanted to keep the girls, but she did not care
for the boys. Dr. Dagan went on the Willamette valley and left
us there. Doctor Whitman finally concluded he would keep the
whole seven of us and took us in charge. We lived there three
years. I might say something of the home incidents. The first
thing Mrs. Whitman did was to cut our hair, wash and scrub us,
as we were very much in need of a cleaning up; then she gave
us something to eat and the bread seemed very dark to us&mdash;it
was unbolted flour. Mrs. Eads, who had been caring for my
baby sister, five months old, arrived three days later and then
Mrs. Whitman took the motherless little one in charge and she
grew to be a fine baby. Everything was so different from what
we had been used to. The Whitmans were New England people
and we were taken into their home and they began the routine
of teaching and disciplining us in the old Puritan way of raising
and training children&mdash;very different to the way of the plains.
They hired a teacher and the immigrant families all had the
privilege of sending their children to this school during the
winter months. We had a church and Sunday school every
Sabbath and we had our family worship every morning and
evening. We had certain things to do at a certain hour. We
never had anything but corn meal mush and milk for our suppers
and they were very particular in our being very regular in all
our habits of eating and sleeping.</p>

<p>When the spring came all the immigrants left and went on
down to the Willamette valley&mdash;the families who had wintered
at the Mission leaving the Sager children behind with the big-hearted
Dr. and Mrs. Whitman. We had our different kinds
of work to do. We had to plant all the gardens and raise vegetables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">Nine</a></span>
for the immigrants who came in for supplies. We got
up early in the morning and we each had our piece of garden
to weed and tend. We had to wipe the dishes and mop the
floors. We had verses of scripture to learn each morning which
we had to repeat at the family worship. The seven verses would
be our Sunday school lesson. We took turns in giving our passages
of Scripture. Everything was done in routine. Sometimes
we had to walk in the afternoon. Mrs. Whitman would
go with us; we would gather specimens and she would teach
us botany. During the summer when the Indians went to the
buffalo grounds, we were alone and we looked forward to the
coming of the immigrants as one of the great events of our life.
Sometimes in the summer we went bathing in the river. We
would get the Indian girls to teach us to swim. Once, Missionary
and Mrs. Eels came down from Walker's Prairie, having
with them a girl by the name of Emma Hobson, and the latter
went in bathing with us children; she could not swim and the
current swept her down the river. She caught on an overhanging
bush and an Indian took her out of the river and put a blanket
around her. Mrs. Eels gave the alarm. We always called that
"Emma's place." We cut water melons in two and strung them
together and would play for hours with those water melon boats,
having a great deal of enjoyment. Still, discipline was strict
and when we were told to do a thing, no matter what, we went.</p>

<p>Once a month we had a missionary meeting and we would
sing missionary hymns and the Whitmans would read extracts
from missionary papers. They took the Sandwich Island paper,
the editor being the Rev. Damon. There was a man at the
Mission by the name of O'Kelley; he was an Irishman, and he
went with the Doctor who had to go out and give the Indians
a lesson in farming. They took all we girls in a wagon and this
man O'Kelley drove. Dr. Whitman showed the Indians how
to cultivate their little patches. There was not very much cultivation
about anything, however. O'Kelley was to cook the
dinner. He had a big chunk of beef to boil and he told us he
would give us a big dinner&mdash;would give us some "drap" dumplings;
so we became very curious to know what "drap" dumplings
were. No doubt they were "drap" dumplings, because they
went to the bottom of the kettle and staid there until we fished
them out. We put in the day there. Returning, my brother
took me on his horse and some of the others rode in the wagon.
We had riding mares and they had colts. When we came to
the Walla Walla River the colts began floating down stream
and we had an awful time, but I hung on. I had on an old
sunbonnet, but I lost it. We finally got safely home.</p>

<p>The summer of '46 the Doctor went down into the Willamette
valley and while he was down there my sister and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">Ten</a></span>
drove the cows off in the morning to pasture and while we were
roaming along we looked for different kinds of herbs that the
Indians eat; we got hold of something and started to eat it.
I told sister it was poison, but she said if the Indians could eat
it, it was all right. I ate some of it, became very ill, but managed
to get home, falling just outside the door. They carried me in
and found I had been eating wild parsnip and was very sick.
Life was dispaired of and Mrs. Whitman sent a messenger to
the Willamette valley to bring the Doctor home. He came on
horseback as fast as he could, finding me somewhat better. I
was able to go around the house, feebly. Everyone was eager
to see the Doctor, but he hardly looked to the right or left,
coming quickly to me, took me up in his arms and then went
out and gave them all a greeting. He seemed to be so anxious
about me. I always remember that.</p>

<p>Once in a while we would have a picnic. Mrs. Whitman
would fix up some food and we would go picnicing in the woods
and do different things to employ our time. It was a lonesome
place away back there, shut in the hills.</p>

<p>In the spring of '46 we hitched up the wagon and thought
we would go with Mrs. Spalding and one of the Walker boys
on a trip. We went where the city of Walla Walla now stands.
There were just four lone cabins there; they had large fireplaces
and big stick chimneys. We only took provisions for the day.
We turned the oxen out to graze and when we were ready to
go home they could not be found. My brother went to to look for
them, but being unable to find them, we had to stay there all night.
We had a few blankets, for we always took some with us even
on a short trip. When it came time to go to bed we had our
prayers. Mrs. Whitman had taught us to memorize Scripture
and the children took turns in repeating the verses, "Let not
your hearts be troubled." We had songs and prayers and then
laid down and went to sleep. The next day we found a large
fish in the creek and we had some of it for dinner. My brother
came and took us home and we called what is now known as
Walla Walla, the "Log City."</p>

<p>Some eight years ago I was in the city of Walla Walla and
standing in the door of a drug store, looked down the main
street. As I looked down the street where the creek makes a
turn and where there are many bushes of alder and willow, I
saw what I saw in '46. There were some cabins down in there
and I said to the proprietor, a friend of mine, "It seems to me
it looks familiar."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you are right. It is supposed they were
put there for trapping and quarters by the Hudson's Bay men,
but it is not certain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">Eleven</a></span>In '46 all this Northwest territory was jointly occupied by
English and Americans and it was not settled. Dr. Whitman
and Mr. Spalding with their wives were the first homeseekers
to cross the Rockies and it was just a string of Hudson's Bay
posts all the way. Aside from the four missionary stations there
were no other American settlements, save in the Willamette valley.
Vancouver, Washington, was a Hudson's Bay post then.</p>

<p>We used to go to the Indian lodges sometimes. Doctor would
talk to them about the Bible and on a few occasions we were
invited to a feast where they ate with big horn spoons. Once
a year the Indians went to the buffalo hunting grounds and
came back with jerked or dried meat which we enjoyed very
much. They also gathered huckleberries in the Blue Mountains
and we bought and dried large quantities of berries for
our own use. The Doctor had quite large fields of corn and the
crows were very troublesome; so we children had to go up and
down the rows ringing bells to scare them away. That was one
of the things that kept us busy. He had a large family and the
immigrants came there for supplies. He had to make use of a
primitive custom in saving his crops; the grain was harvested by
sickles and tramped out by the horses and winnowed. He had
a mill out of which came the unbolted flour; we never had white
flour. There were some sheep and some beef cattle. Dr. Whitman
always sent the immigrants on to the Willamette valley as
fast as he could; but many were obliged to remain at the Mission
on account of their oxen having given out and he had to feed
from fifty to seventy-five persons during the winter months.
One of the jobs that I disliked in the fall was when he pulled up
the white beans and every child was given a tin cup and told to
pick up these beans with their hands. Every bean had to be saved.</p>

<p>We also had hogs. We raised a few, but never ate the
pork, reserving that for the immigrants. The Doctor furnished
them with meat, flour and vegetables through the winter and
what work there was to be done they helped with, though there
was little to be done at that season of the year; looking after
the stock that was turned out and getting up a little firewood was
about all that they could do for the Doctor.</p>

<p>I can never forget the Sunday services and the Sunday school
held in the Whitman home. The first time I ever heard the
song "Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing"; it was sung by an
old Baptist believer at the Whitman house.</p>

<p>In the fall of '45 a family named Johnson came, who had
a young daughter eighteen or nineteen years of age and Mrs.
Whitman hired her to help with the family work; she also studied
and the Doctor and his wife taught her all they could. The
Doctor also treated her mother, who was paralyzed. This woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">Twelve</a></span>
husband would carry his wife in his arms to the evening meetings,
place her in a chair and then all would join in "Come Thou
Fount of Every Blessing." The daughter, Miss Johnson, instead
of going into the valley with her family went to Lapwai and
worked for Mrs. Spalding, and was there at the time of the
Massacre. Mrs. Whitman used to go to Fort Walla Walla to
make little visits. Sometimes she took one child and sometimes
another and once she took me. It was a great treat to be allowed
to go so far as Fort Walla Walla, right on the Columbia River.
When the boats came in sight of the Fort, they were saluted by
the firing of a cannon. I was frightened. I had never before
heard a cannon and I held on to Mrs. Whitman. She told me to
have no fear for they were only firing to salute the boats.</p>

<p>Once they sent me to the river for water and I became badly
frightened. I raced to the house and tried to tell how this queer
animal acted and how I felt; they thought it was some wild
animal and my brother went down with his gun, to find it was
only a huge toad. Mrs. Whitman taught us the love of flowers.
We each had a flower garden, which we had to weed and care
for. She had my brothers take a tin case and gather flowers as
they would ride over the country and on their return would
press them. She taught us a great deal about things of that kind
and instilled in us a love of the beautiful. That kept our minds
busy and cultivated a feeling of reverence for Nature.</p>

<p>An artist named Kane was sent out by the English government.
He took pictures of the Mission. We children were
cleaning up the yard and varying labor by trying to balance
the rake on our fingers. Mrs. Whitman reproved us, saying
she did not want that in the picture. It was customary to ask
individuals what church denomination they belonged to and one
day we discovered a man sitting outside the kitchen door; sister
Elizabeth asked him about his church. He said he was a Methodist.
She came in and told us, "There's a Methodist out there."
As we had never seen a Methodist, we looked at him in wonder;
but soon found he was not different from other men, and making
up our minds he was not dangerous, went and talked with him.</p>

<p>One year Mrs. Whitman took a trip to visit the Eels and
Walker Mission, taking my sister with her that time. She tried
to take us on these little trips to break the monotony and let
us see something besides our home life. We didn't have any
shoes in those days&mdash;we went barefooted. In the winter we
had moccasins, but they were not much protection. Shoes were
not to be had in that part of the world. Our dresses for winter
were made of what was called "baize-cloth," purchased from
the Hudson's Bay Company. For summer, our dresses were
made of a material much resembling the hickory shirting so
much used at that time. We did not have a very big assortment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">Thirteen</a></span>
of clothing; and we wore sunbonnets. Wash-day was a great
day; it meant a very early rising, though the boys did most of the
washing. When it came ironing day, all the youngsters had to
iron. Mrs. Whitman taught us according to our years, to do
all kinds of housework. We used to hire the Indians to dig
our potatoes. They dug them with camas sticks. They were
good at stealing the best of them, and good at stealing other
people's water melons.</p>

<p>I can see in memory that there was a great deal of wild
rye grass on the surrounding plains. Waillatpu means "rye
grass." Droves of Indian horses would come through there.
The grass was so tall I could just see their manes and tails.
The land is now under cultivation. The wolves were very plentiful
and one winter&mdash;'45&ndash;6&mdash;they became so poor and starved
they would come right up to the door hunting for food. The
Walla Walla River froze over, so that holes had to be cut in
the ice for the sheep to obtain water. Some of the sheep fell in.
One day we came down from the school for our dinner and in the
kitchen the Doctor had five sheep, warming them up. He had
rescued them from the water, but Mrs. Whitman was very indignant
that he had turned the kitchen into a sheep pen.</p>

<p>In November of 1847 many immigrants had gathered at the
Mission, intending to winter there. Measles had broken out
among them and many of the Indians had also become victims
of this disease and the Doctor was very busy attending them
all. On the 27th of the month, Mr. Spalding, who had come
to the Whitman mission on business, went with Dr. Whitman
to visit the sick at Umatilla and to remain over night. The
Doctor was very worried because there were so many sick at his
Mission, having ten of his own family down and Mrs. Whitman
much alarmed about the children. Some of them were very low&mdash;especially
my sister Louise and Helen Marr Meek. Leaving Mr.
Spalding at Umatilla, the Doctor started for home, meeting
Frank Sager on the way, who had been sent by Mrs. Whitman
to ask him to return at once because of the critical condition of
some of the family. After reaching home, he told the boys to
go to bed and he would sit up and look after the sick. So all
went upstairs to bed and to sleep, little dreaming of the march
of events that would blot out splendidly useful lives on the
morrow and leave the girls of the Sager family again without
protectors.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenumindent h2"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">Fourteen</a></span><a name="THE_MASSACRE" id="THE_MASSACRE">THE MASSACRE</a></h2>


<p>The morning of the 29th of November, 1847, was a dark,
dreary day. When I came downstairs I went into the kitchen
where Dr. Whitman was sitting by the cookstove broiling steak
for breakfast. I went and put my arms around his neck and
kissed him and said, "Good morning, father," as we were taught
to greet older persons with all politeness; also to say "Good night"
to all as we retired. I continued, "I have had such a bad dream
and I woke frightened."</p>

<p>He said, "What was it?"</p>

<p>"I dreamed that the Indians killed you and a lot of others."</p>

<p>He replied, "That was a bad dream, but I hope it will not
occur."</p>

<p>The rest of the family who were able came to the table
and we had breakfast; there was to be an Indian funeral later
and the Doctor was to conduct it; so we separated and went to
our various employments. Many of our family were sick. Those
able to attend school were my brother Frank and myself, the
two sons of Mr. Manson, a Hudson's Bay man, who were boarding
with the Whitmans for the winter in order to attend the
Mission school; Eliza Spalding, daughter of the Rev. H. H.
Spalding, having arrived with her father a few days before;
David Malin, a half breed. 'Liza was to remain for the winter.
There were eight members of our family not well enough to
attend school that morning, and most of the children of the
immigrant families wintering there were unable to attend. I
can recall only a few of these children besides those of our own
family that were at school that morning, it being Monday and
the first day of the term. School had not been in session before
that, on account of so much sickness.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock we went to the schoolroom. Mr. Sanders
was the teacher. Joe Stansfield went out that morning to drive
in a beef animal from the range to be killed and brother Frank
was the one to shoot it down. That made him late for school
and when he came in school had been in session perhaps half
an hour. When the hour for the forenoon recess had come,
the girls had theirs first and we went over to the Doctor's kitchen.
My brother John, who was just recovering from a severe case
of measles, was sitting there with a skein of brown twine around
his knees, winding it into a ball for there were brooms to be
made soon. We all got a drink of water. John asked me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">Fifteen</a></span>
bring him some and after he had drank, said, "Won't you hold
the twine for me?"</p>

<p>I replied, "'Tis only recess, but I will hold it at noon." The
bell called us then, so we returned to the schoolroom and the
boys were given their recess. The beef was being dressed in
the meadow grass, northeast and not far from the school house.
Three or four white men were at work and a lot of Indians
were gathered around with their blankets closely wrapped about
them and it is supposed that they had their guns and tomahawks
under them. The boys went to where the beef was being dressed;
in a short time we heard guns and the boys came running in
and said the Indians were killing the men at the beef. Mr.
Sanders opened the door and we looked out. We saw Mr. Rogers
run from the river to the Mission house and Mr. Kimball running
with his sleeves rolled up and his arms all bloody; he ran
around the end of the house to the east door and Mrs. Whitman
let him in. Mr. Hoffman was fighting with an Indian, swinging
an ax; he was at the beef. Mr. Sanders ran down the steps,
probably thinking of his family, but was seized by two Indians;
he broke away from them and started for the immigrant house
where his family were. One Indian on horseback and two on
foot ran after him and overtook him just as he reached the fence
to cross it; they killed him and cut his head off and the next day
I saw him lying there with his head severed. Mrs. Whitman stood
at a door which had a sash window, looking at the attack on Mr.
Sanders. Mr. Rogers came to the door and she let him in; his
arm was broken at the wrist.</p>

<p>Mary Ann Bridger was the only eye-witness of the attack on
Dr. Whitman and John Sager, which had occurred just before
the attack on the men at the beef. She ran out of the kitchen
door and around the house and got into the room where Mrs.
Whitman and the rest of the family were and cried, "Oh, the
Indians are killing father and John!" It seems that after attending
the Indian funeral, the Doctor returned to his home, where,
soon after, some Indians came into the kitchen and as Dr. Whitman
started to go from the living room to the kitchen he said
to his wife, "Lock the door after me," which she did. In the
course of conversation regarding the condition of the sick Indian,
one of those in the kitchen slipped up behind the good man,
drew a tomahawk from under his blanket and sank it into the
Doctor's skull. Others attacked John Sager. Their dastardly
deed accomplished, they left the room, not paying any attention
to the fact that the little half-breed girl had run out; then they
joined those around the beef and the general attack immediately
began. The Doctor was not instantly killed. Mrs. Hays, Mrs.
Hall and Mrs. Sanders came running to the Mission house for
protection and Mrs. Whitman and Mrs. Hall unbolted the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">Sixteen</a></span>
went into the kitchen and brought the wounded man into the
living room and laid him on the floor, putting a pillow under
his head. Mrs. Whitman got a towel and some ashes from the
stove and tried to staunch the blood. He lingered but a short
time, for the blow of his treacherous adversary had been sure
and deadly. Mrs. Whitman went to the sash door and looked
out to see what had become of those around the beef. She
stood there watching, when Frank Iskalome, a full blooded
Indian, shot her in the left breast, through the glass. Sister
Elizabeth was standing beside her and heard her exclaim, "I am
wounded; hold me tight." The women took hold of her and
placed her in a chair; then she began to pray that "God would
save her children that soon were to be orphaned and that her
dear mother would be given strength to bear the news of
her death."</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Rogers suggested that they all go up stairs
for safety. The only weapon of defense they had was an old,
broken gun; but when the Indians would start to come up, as
they did after a time, some one of them would point it over the
stairs, and the Indians were afraid to face it. Miss Bewley and
her brother had staid behind their family, to winter at the Mission.
She was sick and the Doctor thought he could treat and
help her; she would not consent to remain unless her brother
staid also; he was lying in bed in a little room off the kitchen,
very sick with measles, during the attack upon the Doctor and
John, but the Indians paid no attention to him at that time.
Miss Bewley was supposed to assist with the housework and to
teach the girls some fancy work&mdash;knitting, tatting, etc.&mdash;the few
kinds of such work as was done in that day. The Doctor had
been asked to go up to see her that morning, as she was reported
to be in a very excited state. He found her weeping bitterly,
but she would give him no reason as to why she cried so hard.
He came down and asked Mrs. Whitman to go up and see if
she could not comfort her. This was early Monday morning.
Another incident that fixes the day and time as the Monday forenoon
recess is this. One of the fixed rules of the Doctor's was
the hour of the day we took our baths, both summer and winter&mdash;eleven
o'clock in the morning; and as we did not get our usual
baths on the Saturday previous on account of the sickness of so
many of the children, Mrs. Whitman was bathing a part of them
this Monday morning. Some were out of the tub and dressed;
one was in the tub and some were dressing. Elizabeth said that
mother came and told them, in a calm tone of voice, to dress
quickly and then she helped the one who was in the tub to get
out and assisted her to dress. This is the hour that is fixed in
my mind beyond a doubt, as the hour of the massacre, regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">Seventeen</a></span>
of the statement of others that it was two or three o'clock in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Now to return to the schoolroom. My brother Frank came
in with the other boys and shut the door, saying, "We must hide."
So we climbed to a loft that was above a part of the schoolroom
and was sometimes used as the teacher's bedroom. It did not
extend to the ceiling, but was so arranged that it left a hall on
the south side of the building where there were two windows
giving light to the main room. There was a fireplace in the
schoolroom. In order to get up to the loft, we had to set a
table under the opening and pile books on it; one of the boys
got up first and then we girls stepped on the books and the boy
above managed to pull us up, until finally all were up and hidden
among the rubbish that had accumulated there. Frank told us
all to ask God to save us and I can see him now, after all the
years that have passed, as he kneeled and prayed for God to spare
us. It seemed as though we had been there a long time, when
the door was opened and Joe Lewis and several Indians came
into the schoolroom and called "Frank." As they got no answer,
he called the Manson boys and they answered. Lewis then said
for all to come down and the two Mansons, about 16 and 17
years of age, and David Malin, 6 or 7 years, went among the
first; then the girls. I was afraid to try to jump to the floor,
but Lewis said, "Put your feet over the edge and let go and
I will catch you." He failed to do this and I struck the floor
hard, hurting my head. When he helped me up I was dazed and
when he asked me "Where is Frank?" I replied, "I don't know."
Frank remained quiet and it evidently did not occur to any one
to search for him in the loft.</p>

<p>They sent the Hudson Bay boys and the half-breed Indian boy
in charge of an Indian to Finlay's lodge and from there they were
sent the next day to Fort Walla Walla and were safe there.
Later, after the rescue of the survivors, the two Manson boys
went down the river from the fort with us; but they would not
let the boy David go, claiming him as a Canadian. His father
was a Spaniard and his mother a squaw. The last look I had
of him was when we rowed away from Fort Walla Walla, leaving
him standing on the bank of the river crying as though his
heart were breaking.</p>

<p>Lewis said to me, "Where do you want to go?"</p>

<p>I said, "I want to go to the kitchen where John is."</p>

<p>He replied, "John is dead and the rest of them."</p>

<p>I said, "I don't believe it, for he was there when I went down
at recess."</p>

<p>But he took my hand and the rest of the children followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">Eighteen</a></span>
with the Indians bringing up the rear. When we went into the
kitchen, the dead body of John laid on the floor and his blood
had run and made a stream of dark, congealed crimson. He
laid on his back with one arm thrown up and back and the other
outstretched and the twine still around his knees. It appeared
as if he had been hit and just slipped out of the chair he was
sitting on. We children all sat down on the settle that was near
the stove. A stove was a luxury in those days; there was one
in the living room and in the kitchen, where the children sat
in terror, was a Hudson's Bay cook stove of a very small and
primitive make; the oven was directly over the firebox and two
kettles which were of an oblong shape sat in on the side, something
like the drum on the sides of a stove. The kettle of meat
had been put on to cook for dinner and was still on the stove.
Joe Lewis took a piece out and cut it up, put it on the lid of
the kettle and said, "You children haven't had any dinner," and
passed it to us, but none of us could eat.</p>

<p>The room was full of Indians and they would point their
guns at us, saying "Shall we shoot?" and then flourish their
tomahawks at our defenseless heads. One of them had on John's
straw hat that he had braided from straw cut from wild grass
one summer when he was working for the Rev. Spalding. Mrs.
Spalding had sewed it for him. The Indian's name was Klokamus.
Later, he was one of five hanged at Oregon City in the
summer of 1850. The pantry was being plundered by the squaws.
In memory, I can hear the rattle of the dried berries on the
floor as they emptied the receptacles of them, in order to get the
pans and cans to carry away. Joe Lewis went into the living
room and must have gone into the parlor where mother had a
large wooden chest in which she kept her choice clothing and
keepsakes; he came out with five nice, fancy gauze kerchiefs
of different colors, made to wear with a medium low-necked
dress. He gave them to the Chief and the headmen that were
in the room.</p>

<p>In a short time my brother Frank came into the room. He
sat down beside me, saying "I came to find you. John is dead
and we don't know what has become of the rest of the family;
the Indians are going to kill me and what will become of you,
my poor, little sister?" Word was finally passed out not to kill
any of the children and we were ordered out of the house, so
we went and stood in a corner where the "Indian room" made
an ell with the main part of the house; the Indians were very
numerous, some of them on horses and most of them armed and
painted and they seemed to be waiting for something. Soon out
came the immigrant women that had all fled to the Mission
house for safety upon the outbreak of the massacre; as they
passed us their children went with their mothers, leaving Frank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">Nineteen</a></span>
Eliza Spalding and myself standing there. They were followed
by Mr. Rogers and Joe Lewis bearing a settee with the wounded
Mrs. Whitman on it, covered up with blankets and Elizabeth
close beside it, her arms laden with clothing. When they had
gotten out of and a short distance from the house in an open
space, Joe Lewis dropped his end of the settee. Mr. Rogers
looked up quickly and must have realized what it meant; but
he was shot instantly and fell and an Indian tried to ride his
horse over him. Elizabeth turned about and ran back into the
house. Then an Indian came to Mrs. Whitman and took his
whip and beat her over the face and head and then turned the
settee over in the mud. She was very weak from loss of blood;
my sister Catherine told me and I am convinced that she did
not last long after being beaten and thrown face down in the
mud, with the blankets and settee on top of her.</p>

<p>An Indian came and stood by Frank and another one took
up his stand close by and they talked together earnestly; the
first one was a friendly one and he seemed to be pleading with
the other to spare Frank's life, but finally the ugly one took hold
of my brother and said, "You are a bad boy." Then he shoved
him a short distance from my side and an Indian shot him in
the breast; he fell and did not struggle and I think he died
instantly as he made no movement. The Indians all went away
then and the women and children that belonged in the immigrant
house were gone and Eliza and I were alone. We seemed to
be paralyzed and the horrors we had passed through so numbed
our thoughts that we did not seem to think that we could go to
the other house, as we had been taught not to go where we had
not had permission. It was getting quite dark by this time, in
the short November day, and we stood close together, when a
friendly Indian came; he was the one that had pleaded for
Frank's life and he took us by the hands and led us over to
Mrs. Sander's door. She took us in and gave us some supper
and one of the other families took Eliza in to give her a place
to sleep.</p>

<p>When I had eaten my supper, Miss Bewley asked me if I
would go over to the Whitman house to take food to her brother
who was lying terribly ill in the little room just off the kitchen.
He had seen and heard some of the awful things that had taken
place during the day, but had not been molested, probably because
the Indians thought him dying anyway. I told her I was afraid
to go, as I would have to step over the dead bodies. Mrs.
Sanders took me into a bedroom and spread a quilt on the floor
and I laid down, but not to sleep until far into the night. Mr.
Gillam, the tailor, had been wounded while sitting on his table
sewing and had run into this room; he was suffering terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">Twenty</a></span>
and begging to be put out of his misery; along towards morning
he was given his release from suffering.</p>

<p>We got up very early and ate a scant breakfast, as we
knew not what daylight would bring. The Indians would surely
ask to be fed as they were then sitting in the early glimmerings
of light on Monument hill, chanting the Death song. The wind
had blown and whistled so mournfully in the night that it had
added to my fear and I never hear the sound of the wind blowing
in the winter, but my mind goes back to that terrible night; and
it has been 72 years since I heard it wail its requium around
desolated Waiilatpu.</p>

<p>My four sisters and the two half-breed girls, with the
wounded Mr. Kimball, were alone in the chamber of the Mission
house all night, for they had made no attempt to leave when the
others had gone in the afternoon. The children were all ill with
measles and two were very ill&mdash;sister Louise and Helen Meek.
They begged constantly for water, but there was none upstairs;
the pitchers of water that were there on Monday morning had
had cloths dipped in them to put on Mrs. Whitman's wounds.
Mr. Kimball's broken arm pained him excessively and he sat
on the floor with his head against a bed until toward morning,
when he told Catherine to tear up a sheet and bandage his arm
and he would go to the river for water.</p>

<p>Catherine said, "Mother wouldn't want the sheets torn up."
"Child, your mother will never need sheets. She is dead,"
was his answer. He went out in the dim morning light and
succeeded in reaching the river, wrapped in the blanket Catherine
had put around him, Indian fashion. Meanwhile the Indians
had come to the immigrant house and had told us to prepare
their breakfast. While they were waiting for their meal, an
outcry was made that drew us all to the north door in the Hall's
room. I stepped out on the lower step and an Indian with a gun
in his hand was on the upper step; we saw the figure of a man
with a white blanket around him, walking near the Doctor's
house; he was near the corn-crib about half way to the house,
when the Indian on the step above me shot, and the man fell.
It was Mr. Kimball returning with water for the fevered children.
I realize that my statement is different from all the others of
the survivors in regard to the killing of Mr. Kimball, but I have
a clear remembrance of this tragedy, which time has not dimmed
or effaced from my mind. According to some, he hid in the
brush till the next day and in working his way to his family
was killed as he was crossing the fence by the house. I remember
the same day, about noon or later, Joe Stanfield came in and
said that a "Boston man" was hiding in the brush. Some of
the women wanted to investigate, but Joe said "No, don't." We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">Twenty-One</a></span>
thought it might be Mr. Hall, as he had gone, as I remember,
early in the morning of the massacre to see if he could shoot
some ducks on the river. He was never heard from or his body
found, so no one knows his fate.</p>

<p>The Osborn family hid under the floor in the Indian room
and remained hidden until in the darkness of the night they came
out, put a little food together, wrapped a coverlid about Mrs.
Osborn and went out into the cold. There were Mr. Osborn
and three children in the party. Mrs. Osborn had been confined
to the bed and this was the first time she had been out of doors
in some days, though that day she had been able to go into Mrs.
Whitman's part of the house. They climbed the fence and took
the irrigation ditch, as it offered more protection for them, being
quite deep with the wild rye grass and buck brush growing thick
and tall on the banks; then they got into the main road and went
on for some distance, finally hiding for the day; besides Mrs.
Osborn was unable to travel further. Their sufferings were
terrible, all being thinly clad. At last Mr. Osborn concluded to
take the oldest boy and go to the Fort, if possible, leaving his
wife and the other children hidden in the bushes. He made
his way to Fort Walla Walla, carrying his boy on his back; the
boy had nothing with which to cover his head. When Mr.
Osborn arrived at the Fort he asked Commander McBaine to
take him in and to furnish him horses and food to use in the
rescue of his wife and the other children. McBaine refused,
saying he "Could not do it."</p>

<p>"I will die at the Fort gates, but I must have help," was
Osborn's reply.</p>

<p>In the happy days before these tragic happenings, an artist
by the name of Stanley came to the Mission. He had been sent
out by the Government for the Smithsonian Institute to take
pictures. At the time of the Massacre he was again on his way
to visit the Mission. He and his Indian guide intended to go
down into the Willamette valley, near Oregon City, to winter.
Meeting an Indian woman, she told him everyone was killed at
the Mission; he was asked if he was a "Boston man" or a Frenchman
and replying that he was a Frenchman, was allowed to
proceed unmolested. He reached the Fort in safety and when
McBaine refused to let Mr. Osborn have horses, said to the
latter, "You can have my horse and what provisions I have,"
and he also gave him a silk handkerchief to tie on the child's
head. Stitkus, an Indian, took his own French chapeau and
put it on Mr. Osborn's head. McBaine at last gave an Indian
a blanket if he would go with Mr. Osborn and rescue the family;
but he instructed him not to bring them to the Fort, but to take
them to an Indian village. The mother and children were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">Twenty-Two</a></span>
with some difficulty, and as they came to the fork in the road on
the return, one leading to the Umatilla Indian village where
their lives would not have been safe, and the other to the Fort
and security, the Indian, disregarding McBaine's explicit directions,
refused to take the one to the village and insisted that they
proceed to the Fort. The little party did so, and were finally
admitted. Their hardships were many, even there; but they
remained until such time as we were all ransomed. This is as
I remember hearing from sister Catherine as she, later, lived
close to the Osborn family in the Willamette valley and she and
Mrs. Osborn were together frequently; also from the account
sworn to by Mr. Osborn in Gray's History.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, Miss Bewley made some gruel, hoping
to be able to send it over to her sick brother. Chief Tilokaikt
came in and she told him of her brother and he was very sympathetic
and took a number of us in charge to go over to the Mission
house. Some of the party went inside of the fence on the north
side, while some took the south side which was the public road.
When we were a few yards from the house, we saw Mr. Sander's
body lying there; then we heard a cry and saw Catherine and
Elizabeth coming, each carrying a sick child in their arms. The
women hastened to meet them and helped them to the house,
which had sheltered us through the night. Poor Mary Ann
Bridger was tottering along by herself. They had to leave Helen
Meek alone and we could hear her screaming and begging to be
taken also, disregarding Catherine's assurance that she would
soon return for her. At last all the sick ones were transferred
to the immigrant house, save Mr. Bewley; and Mr. Sales, who
was also very ill in the blacksmith shop. Sister Louise died
five days after this and Helen Meek a few days after her.</p>

<p>This same morning (Tuesday) we were given muslin to
make sheets to wrap the dead in and Wednesday morning Joe
Stansfield and the women helped to cover and sew them in these
sheets. He had dug a long trench about three feet deep and six
feet long; then all the bodies were put in a wagon and hurried
to the grave. They were all piled up like dead animals in the
wagon bed. A runaway occurred and scattered some of the
bodies along the road and they had to be picked up. There was
a Catholic father who was visiting the Indians and he went up
to the hole where they were burying them and helped. He would
take hold of one end of a body and Joe Stansfield hold of the
other and they would lay them in this shallow place until all
the victims were ranged side by side&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Whitman,
then the two Sager boys and Mr. Rogers, and so on, then covered
with the earth.</p>

<p>There were two families living about twenty miles away at
a sawmill which belonged to Dr. Whitman. Mr. Young had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">Twenty-Three</a></span>
three grown boys and Mr. Smith also had a family, one of
whom, Mary Smith, was attending the Mission school. The
morning after the massacre the oldest son of the Young family,
in entire ignorance of what had occurred, started for the Mission
with a load of lumber and to get provisions for the return trip.
The Indians killed him two miles from the Mission. His family
could not understand why he did not return and became alarmed.
They finally sent another son by another road and he arrived
without being attacked, but was informed by Joe Stansfield that
his brother had been killed by Indians and had been buried where
he fell. This young fellow, finding that we were getting out
of flour, remained at Waiilatpu as there was no man to run the
grist mill. Mr. Bewley and Mr. Sales became better and were
able to sit up and get about a bit. One day Mr. Sales was sitting
by the stove and an Indian began talking to him, telling him he
was getting stronger and would soon be able to work for the
Indians; that they were soon to put out all the women and
children and they would all have to work all the time. Mr. Sales
replied that he was a good worker and would labor constantly
for them if they would only spare his life. It was only a day or
two after this that the two men were attacked while on their bed,
beaten with clubs and whips and finally killed and their bodies
thrown out of doors. Most of the women and children started
to run out of doors, but an Indian caught and held me until they
had finished the terrible deed.</p>

<p>Miss Bewley was sent for by the chief of the Umatillas
and in spite of heartrending protests was obliged to accompany
the messenger sent for her.</p>

<p>One morning Joe Stansfield saw wolves at the grave and
went up there to find that they were digging into it. He heaped
more earth over it, but later, after we had left the place and had
been redeemed, soldiers going there found that the wolves had
succeeded in desecrating the last resting place of our loved ones.
Bones were scattered about and on some of the bare bushes
were strands of Mrs. Whitman's beautiful, long, golden hair.
They collected the bones and again buried them, heaping the
earth high and turning a wagon-box over the grave. For fifty
years nothing more was done to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Spalding came within two miles of the Mission on
Wednesday morning, when he met a Catholic father, his Indian
interpreter and another Indian. Sending the two Indians ahead,
the priest told Mr. Spalding of the massacre, assuring him that
all the women, save Mrs. Whitman, and all the children had been
spared; that his daughter was alive and that now was his time
to escape, as the Indian who had joined him and his interpreter
intended to kill him. The father gave him what food he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">Twenty-Four</a></span>
and Mr. Spalding turned his horse's head towards the Walla
Walla river. He followed down the bank of the Walla Walla,
traveling by night and hiding by day. For a time he kept his
horse, but Indians passed near his hiding place and he had to
rub his mount's nose to keep his from neighing and thus betraying
him. The horse got away from him finally and he had to
travel afoot in the storm. All the subsistence he had was wild
rose-hips. After a week's travel he reached the Clearwater,
close to where his family was, though he did not know this fact,
believing that they also might have been killed. He proceeded
very carefully, thinking the Indians hostile, but knowing that
if he could make in safety the lodge of an Indian by the name
of Luke, he would be safe. He was tired and worn out with
travel. At last he was close enough to the lodge to listen to
family worship and assured by the knowledge that they still
acknowledged the white man's God, knew it would be safe for
him to enter; but so exhausted was he that he fell when just
inside the door of the tepee and his cap fell off. At first the
Indians thought he was a ghost, but when they saw his bald
head, they realized he was still in the flesh and then proceeded
to feed and care for him. They told him that his family was
at Craig's mountain and later they took him back up there.
Mrs. Spalding, when she heard of the massacre, called the head
men of the tribe and put herself on their mercy and under their
protection. They said they would protect her and suggested
that they start at once for Craig's home. She said that this was
the Sabbath and they must not travel on that day. The Presbyterian
Indians never travel on the Sabbath and the brave little
woman, reminding them of their religion, knowing at the same
time that it might lessen her chances of escape, induced them
to postpone starting until the following day, when they took
her to Craig's, where she remained until rescued from the Indians.
She sent two Indians, Timothy and Grey Eagle, down to the
Mission to ask if her captors would not release Eliza Spalding
and let them take her to her mother; but they would not listen
and refused to give her up. These two Indians came when
Helen Meek was dying from the measles. Timothy went in to
see her and fell on his knees by the side of her bed, praying in
his own language; when he arose, he pointed upward, indicating
that the spirit had flown.</p>

<p>When the news of the massacre was taken to Fort Vancouver,
Peter Skeen Ogden, the chief factor, declared he must
take goods and go to the rescue of the women and children before
the volunteers could go up there; he believed that if the Indians
thought the volunteers were to attempt a rescue, that they would
kill all their prisoners, for they well knew that they deserved
punishment for their dastardly deeds. With no prisoners to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">Twenty-Five</a></span>
hamper them, they could perhaps elude any pursuing band of
volunteers. Douglass objected, reminding his superior that he
would be obliged to use in barter goods belonging to another
government than the United States, without knowing if the
latter government would reimburse him for them or not. "If the
United States will not pay for them, then I will pay for them out
of my own pocket, but those unfortunate captives must be rescued
at once," said this great-hearted man. He proceeded to
Fort Walla Walla and called a council of chiefs and other Indians
and finally after some days of discussion, made this treaty with
them. They were to deliver the prisoners to him, for which they
would receive goods valued at five hundred dollars from the Hudson
Bay people; it was stipulated that Mr. Spalding's family and
Miss Bewley should all be brought in. During the time of the
parley small bands of Indians were constantly passing the Mission,
going to and from the place of treaty-making. One party
in passing thought to play a joke on those who were guarding
us and shot off their guns, making quite a commotion and causing
our captors to think that the "Boston men" were at hand. They
began to grab up some of the children to kill them; one caught
me up and started to thrust a tomahawk into my brains. Just
then the Indians outside began laughing and the brutes, on murder
bent, concluded the noise was all a joke and did not hurt any of us.</p>

<p>We were directed to cook a supply of food as provision for
the trip. Fifty Nez Perce warriors escorted the Spalding family
through the hostile country and an Indian brought Miss Bewley to
the immigrant house where the rest of us were. They took us
down to Fort Walla Walla in ox wagons. Among other things
which I remember we left behind was a pair of pigeons the Canfield
family had brought with them from Iowa. The cage was set
in the window on leaving, the door knocked off, and the pigeons
were still sitting in their cage&mdash;the last glimpse we had of them.
After we had been some time on our way, an Indian woman came
out of her lodge and motioned for us to go fast&mdash;and we did!
It seemed that some of the Indians regretted their bargain and
wanted to take us all prisoners again. This woman knew they
might soon attempt to do so. I was in the last wagon to arrive.
We could see the wagons ahead of us going into the Fort gates
when they were opened and it seemed as if ours would never get
there; but when the last one came up "pel mel" and we were safe
inside, the Indians concluded it was too late to make an attack
and capture us again. The day they were to receive the goods
promised for our release, we were put into rooms out of sight
of the Indians and told to remain there. Of course the Indians
were inside the fort grounds that day, and McBaine was afraid
they might repent the agreement to give us up and try to take
us captive again. Mr. Ogden made the speech and delivered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">Twenty-Six</a></span>
goods and as soon as possible they were gotten away from the
Fort. But they would not let the Indian boy go. The Hudson's
Bay men claimed him as belonging rightfully to them. "He didn't
belong to the Doctor," they said, "but had Indian blood in him."
The last I ever saw of him he was standing on the bank of the
river crying as though his heart were breaking as his friends
floated away from him. He was about six years old. There
were three boats that started down the river the day we left the
Fort, eight oarsmen to a boat, and we pulled out into the stream
pretty fast once we started. Indians were along the bank riding
and talking, and it was necessary to travel fast. At night we
landed and camped. It was cold, windy and sandy. Our belongings
were left for the settlers to bring down in the spring, though,
of course, we children had little to concern ourselves about.
Before we left the Mission Mrs. Sanders had told one of the
chiefs that the Doctor's children had no clothes&mdash;that everything
was gone. "No clothes, no blankets, no nothing," so he went over
to the other house and brought a comfort and gave that to my
oldest sister and gave me a thin quilt and my other sister a blanket
or quilt. It was the custom in those days to quilt so fine; I mean,
with the stitching very close and usually the quilts were made
of two pieces of cloth and a thin layer of cotton batting between.
My quilt got afire on our trip down the river and most of it
was burned. The chief also got us a few undergarments of
Mrs. Whitman's.</p>

<p>Mr. Spalding looked after us on the trip and Mr. Stanley,
who went along also, took especial pains to care for us. He
would do all he could to make the hardships a little easier to
bear, taking pains to wrap us up when in the boat and to see that
we got to camp and back to the boat securely. When we got
to Vancouver, Mr. Stanley bought some calico to make each of
us a dress. I think my portion was five yards and they made me
a dress and bonnet out of it after I went to Mrs. Geiger's. I
do not know what we would have done without Mr. Stanley. He
was so good and kind to us and Mr. Ogden was very kind, too.</p>

<p>We had to make two portages. Once the men had to take
the boats entirely out of the water and carry them around on
their shoulders and let them down the steep banks with ropes,
while we carried the provisions and such small belongings as we
were allowed to take with us. We finally came to Memmaloo's
island, which Mr. Stanley told us was the Indian burying ground.
It took us about eight days to go down the Columbia river. As
we traveled, we came to a place they called St. Helens, then to
another called Linn City and on to Fort Vancouver. We staid
over Sunday there and the Spalding family was entertained at
the Post by Mr. Ogden and James Douglas and finally we were
taken to Portland. Some of the volunteers were on the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">Twenty-Seven</a></span>
of the Willamette river and the Governor was also standing
there as we rowed up. Mr. Ogden went to the Governor, shook
hands and said to him, "Here are the prisoners and now I will
turn them over to you. I have done all I could." He also asked
that we be taken to Oregon City, which was agreed upon and
later, done. Some of the volunteers were camped across the
river and when they saluted the boats we children thought we
were going to be shot. Captain Gilliam, a brother-in-law of the
Captain Shaw who was our protector on the plains after our own
father and mother had died, rowed across the river and asked
which were the Sager children and on our being pointed out to
him, shook hands with us. Some of our forlorn party had friends
to meet them and Governor Abernathy kept the others until
places were found for them.</p>

<p>I remember going to Dr. McLaughlin's house in Oregon City.
Mr. Stanley had a room there and was painting portraits and he
came to take us down to see his pictures. He wanted to paint
my picture, but I was entirely too timid and would not let him.
We enjoyed the pictures, however. When we came down stairs
Dr. McLaughlin and his son-in-law, Mr. Ray, were in the lower
room. As we came down stairs the Doctor, thinking to play a
little practical joke, locked the door on us and told us we were
prisoners again and, of course, we were frightened almost to
death. When he found that he had frightened us, he assured
us he was just fooling and let us go. We took everything in
earnest and were afraid of white people as well as the Indians.
One can hardly realize at this day, in what a tortured state our
nerves were.</p>

id="OREGON_CITY_AFTER_THE_MASSACRE">OREGON CITY&mdash;AFTER THE MASSACRE</a></h2>


<p>My father was born in Virginia, had lived in Ohio, then in
Indiana. Both father and mother dying on the way to Oregon
and the two oldest members of the family then remaining, having
been cruelly torn from us by the massacre, we girls had little
knowledge of any relatives in the East, save that they lived somewhere
in Ohio. Time rolled on. My oldest sister made her home
with the Rev. William and Mrs. Roberts until she married. Mr.
Roberts was a Methodist minister. His sons, in writing a letter
to their grandparents in New Jersey, told of their father and
mother taking an orphan girl by the name of Catherine Sager
to live with them. An extract of this letter was published in the
Advocate and was read by an uncle of mine, who, seeing the
name of Catherine Sager and knowing that his brother Henry
had a daughter by that name, wrote a letter and addressed it to
"Miss Catherine Sager, Somewhere in Oregon." He gave it to
a man who was crossing the plains; he carried it some months
and finally put it in a postoffice near Salem, Oregon, and the
postmaster gave it to my sister. In that way we found our
relatives.</p>

<p>I was with the Spaldings for, I think, four months, and I
attended Mrs. Thornton's private school in the Methodist church.
Then Mr. Spalding decided to go and live in Forest Grove and the
Rev. Mr. Griffin and Mr. Alvin T. Smith came with their ox
teams and moved us out.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Johnson came to the Whitmans in '45, wintered
there and went to the Spalding's mission in '46 and was there
at the time of the massacre and came down the river with us.
She came with the Spalding family to Forest Grove when we
moved. We were taken to the Smith home until the Spalding
family could get a house and settle down.</p>

<p>It was decided, however, that I should go and live with
Mr. and Mrs. Geiger, living on a farm adjoining the Smith's.
The Geigers were a young married couple without children. Mr.
Geiger came on horseback after me the day after we reached
the Smiths, but I cried so hard at the prospect of leaving Mary
Johnson that he went away without me. A day or so later he
came back again and still I would not go, but clung to Mary.
It seemed to me she was my only friend. The third time he
came, I had to go and all my belongings were tied up in a little
bundle. A large bandana handkerchief would have held them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">Twenty-Nine</a></span>
all. I rode behind him. His home was a one-room log house with
a fireplace to cook by. I took up my life there, lonely and isolated.
The nearest neighbor was a mile away. Life was primitive.
If the fire was not carefully covered to keep the coals alive,
we would have to go to a neighbor's to borrow fire. There were
no matches in the country and sometimes I would be sent a mile
across the prairie to bring fire on a shovel from the neighbor's.
If there were no coals, the flint and steel had to be used and if that
was not successful we would have to do without. It was not
always possible to obtain dry sticks in order to make the flint
and steel serve their purpose. Supplies were to be had only from
the Hudson Bay Posts, for people had had to leave most of
their things behind in crossing the plains. That summer a baby
came to the home of the Geiger's and I had to take care of it
and a good deal of the time be nurse and help with the housework.
I had been taught to sew and iron and repair my own clothes and
must have been a really helpful young person. In the fall of
'48 discovery of gold in California made a great change. All
were eager to go to the gold mines. Mr. Geiger got the gold
fever and moved us away up to his father-in-law's, the Rev.
J. Cornwall. This family had moved onto the place in the spring
and had just a log cabin to house a large family. They did not
raise much of a crop the first year and Mr. Cornwall traveled
around and preached over the valley most of the time. That
fall he took a band of sheep in the valley and the winter being
very hard, a good many of them died and his wife had to card
and spin wool, knit socks and sell them to the miners at a dollar
a pair in order to help make the living. She knit all the time
and a part of my work was to help pull the wool off the dead
sheep and wash it and get it ready for her to use. We had to
carry water quite a distance from the river, as it seemed that
many of the early settlers of Oregon had a great habit of building
as far from the river as possible, so we children would have
more to do to pack the water and stamp the clothes with our
feet. We wintered there and in the spring Mrs. Gieger, baby
and I went to their farm thirty-five miles down into the valley
to look after some of their belongings, as the Rev. Spalding, who
had wintered there, had gone to a house of his own. Mr. Geiger
returned unexpectedly from California, went up to get their
things left on the Yamhill, and we settled down on the farm and
life went on. I didn't attend school that year, for there was no
school. The Reverend Eels came down in the spring of 50 to
teach private school. I went three months, walking three and a
half miles each way. Mr. Geiger paid five dollars for three
months' schooling.</p>

<p>There were large herds of Mexican cattle owned in the
valley and they would chase everything except someone on horseback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">Thirty</a></span>
Everyone owned a few of the domestic cattle with them
and they proved very useful, as the tame cattle stood guard until
the others were chased away. I was in continual fear of being
chased by them. They would lie down to watch you all day
and I would skirt along in the bushes, working my way along
tremblingly to get out and away to school without their seeing
me. If these long-horned Spanish cattle chased a person up a
tree they would lie under the tree all day on guard. Wolves
chased the cattle, trying to get the little calves. Pigs would have
to be bedded right up against the house on account of the coyotes
and wolves.</p>

<p>While I was at the Cornwalls in '49, we lived right where
the Indians passed by on the trail coming down the valley.
The Indians were not on reserves then. When the men folks
were gone the women were very afraid of the Indians. They were
women of the South, reared with a certain fear of the negroes,
and this fear extended to the Indians. When the Indians were
in the vicinity they would have me cover up the fire and if any
of the babies needed any attention, I was the one who would
have to give it and rake out the coals and make a fire for the
baby. We had chickens and had a stick chimney; and in a corner
of the chimney was a chicken-roost. One night old Mrs. Cornwall
spied what she thought was an Indian looking through the
chinking of the log house. I said, "Oh, I think not, I don't hear
anything." But they hurried me up to investigate and it was
soon found to be the light shining on the old rooster's eyes.</p>

<p>The summer of '50 I attended school, as I have before said,
going also the next year for three months to the same place, to
the Reverend Eels. Then I did not go any more until the summer
I was thirteen. Mr. Eells moved over near Hillsboro, where
the Reverend Griffin had built a school building on his place and
had hired Mr. Eells to come over and teach and he lived in a
part of Mr. Griffin's house. He called it "Mr. Griffin's select
school." I was permitted to go there and work for my board,
but did not have to work very hard. Mr. Griffin had lots of
cattle and Mr. Eells had one cow; when he was at home he
milked it and when he was not the youngsters had to milk. Mrs.
Griffin and her children had all their cows to milk. They did not
wean the calves, but would turn them all in together and the big
calves would have a fine time getting all the milk. One day I was
milking the cow and I set the milk pail down in the corner and
the old cow got at it and drank all the milk.</p>

<p>I had read of town pumps, but had never seen one until I
went there and I did not like the taste of the water in this, but
Mr. Griffin said it was sulphur water. Finally it got so strong of
sulphur he concluded he had better have the well cleaned out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">Thirty-One</a></span>
so someone came to clean it out and they found a side of bacon,
a skunk, some squirrels and mice. After it was cleaned out, we
had no more sulphur water, but I have never enjoyed the taste
of sulphur water since.</p>

<p>We had a garden. I was very fond of cucumbers and my
favorite pastime in summer after supper was to gather cucumbers,
get a handful of salt and walk up the lane. When anyone
asked about Matilda, someone would reply, "The last I saw of
her she was walking up the lane with salt and cucumbers for
company."</p>

<p>Some of our pastimes, evenings, were to sit together by the
fireplace in Mr. Griffin's home with him as the leader in the
story-telling. We would recount incidents in our lives and then
make up stories and tell them; roast potatoes in the fire, rake
them out with a stick when about half done and each would
have a part of the refreshments of half roasted potatoes and
salt. Mr. Griffin sent and got what he called a seraphine&mdash;a
small cabinet organ; it opened up like a piano and was a wonder
around there. At about eleven o'clock, when we were all in
bed, he would go in where it was kept, open up the organ and
give us some music. His favorite hymn was set to the tune of
"Balerma," and the words were, "Oh, for a closer walk with
God," and he would sing such songs until after midnight. In
the morning he never did any work on the place. He had a
saddle horse and he rode around. Mrs. Griffin and the children
had to do everything. He didn't even plant the potatoes. All the
new potatoes we had grew among the old potatoes that were
dug and stored for the winter and I used to help Mrs. Griffin
get the new potatoes out from among the old ones. I helped
her to churn and in many other ways. She thought I was a
pretty good girl. Mr. Griffin was very fond of entertaining their
company with music. There was a man named Laughlin who
once came to spend the night when it was raining. We were
sitting by the fireplace. The fire did not burn very well and Mrs.
Griffin came in with a little hand bellows and blew up the fire.
The old man saw her coming and fancied it must be a dangerous
instrument of some kind. It frightened him and he got up and
made for the door. He finally saw what it was and came back
and sat down. Then Mr. Griffin sat down by his organ and began
playing it. That frightened the old gentleman again and in his
fright he overturned his chair and got out of the door. He
could not understand what was happening. So we had our fun
with the organ, Mr. Laughlin and the little bellows.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffin liked to give advice to the young. My chum,
Maria Tanner, and I were frequently given the benefit of his
wisdom, but child-fashion, did not care to be "preached at."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">Thirty-Two</a></span>
We would see him coming and would start to evade him. Sometimes
we would dodge around the house, but finally he got on to
our trick and would meet us and corner us and give us whole lot
of advice. He thought it dreadful for young girls to be as
frivolous as we were; for he called it frivolous because we went
down to the woods and sang songs and laughed. That was one
of my sins&mdash;to laugh. We would often lie in bed singing and
laughing and Mr. Eells would call up for us to be quiet. We
would be still until we thought the old man had settled down and
then we would start in again. Children were not supposed to be
in evidence at all in those days, and I sometimes got double doses
of advice and correction. But my school days ended&mdash;when I
was thirteen.</p>

<p>I went back to the Gieger farm where I washed, did housework,
sewed and cared for the children. Sometimes if there had
been a good deal of trouble in the church, the man I lived with
(Mr. Gieger) would not allow me to go to the Grove to church.
But we had a meeting at Mr. Walker's home and Mr. Walker
preached. Sometimes in the winter it was so lonely and cold
that it would be three or four months until we could go out to
church. We looked forward to the campmeetings in June. We
had an old mud oven outside to bake in. The people got together
and furnished provisions; some would bring meat, some potatoes
and some materials for bread. I went with Mrs. Gieger's folks.
One old lady said she went to campmeetings because she got to
see all the old neighbors; and I think they were pretty nearly
our only salvation from entire stagnation. Sometimes we would
go fifty miles to a camp. One of the tricks of the boys was to
shave the tails of the horses; another was to throw tom cats
with their tails tied together in the crowd at the mourner's bench.
This would stop the praying for awhile.</p>

<p>We always picked berries in the spring and summer. There
was not much tame fruit&mdash;a few seedling apples. The only way
we travelled was on horseback. The first printing press that was
brought to Oregon was stored in Mr. Griffin's house. We used
to go to the old press and try to sort out the type. Mrs. Griffin
had a sister, Rachel Smith; the Griffins arranged a match between
her and the Rev. Henry Spalding and she came out from
Boston to marry him. We were invited to the wedding, which
occurred in a schoolhouse used for a church, and the "infare"
was arranged to be held at Mrs. Griffin's the next day. I had
never been to a wedding and I had a great desire to go; so I
went to the wedding in preference to going to the infare, since
I had my choice. Mr. Griffin performed the ceremony. Mr.
Spalding preached the sermon and Mr. Griffin played the organ
and sang. The bride was attired in a white dress and a long,
thin scarf with purple stripes in the ends and fringe and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">Thirty-Three</a></span>
had on a rough straw bonnet. Mrs. Griffin called it "Rachel's
Dunstable bonnet." When they were ready for the ceremony,
Mr. Spalding stepped forward and Mrs. Griffin placed her sister
by his side, putting Miss Smith's hand in his; they stood there
a little while and Mr. Griffin said the words that made them man
and wife. That was my first wedding.</p>

<p>My next experience at a wedding was when I was chosen
to be the bridesmaid. I was to wear a thin blue dress and I
went to the place where the wedding was to occur, carrying
my dress. Our dressing room was to stand on the bed with
curtains around it. The bride was dressed first and then I
dressed myself. We knew of another bride who was coming
and we waited to get the white ribbon bows for the bride to wear
in her hair and the white ribbons to wear around her wrists.
The men were all standing outside the house, as the table was
set for dinner&mdash;the cooking was done at the fireplace&mdash;and there
was not room in the small house for them. Finally when the
bride was ready the best man came in. His name was John
Kane. I discovered he had about half of his coat sleeve ripped
out, but in spite of torn coat, the ceremony proceeded and then
we sat down and had the wedding dinner. The Rev. Walker
performed the ceremony. Among other goodies which we had
on the table were glasses of syrup. There was something a little
bit white in it and I found that it was pie-dough cut out with a
thimble and baked and dropped in it for an ornament. The next
day the bride and groom and myself were to take a trip. The
best man's sweetheart got very jealous of me because I acted as
bridesmaid with her intended husband as best man. Engaged
couples at that time were supposed to look only at each other.
There were two couples besides the bride and groom, who took
a horseback trip to Scroggin's valley; we went about fifteen
miles, I should judge, and ate dinner with a brother of the groom.
They had not been married very long and were starting in housekeeping.
We went on to Mr. Tanner's and spent the night,
leaving the bride and groom at his brother's. Our trip covered
about fifty miles.</p>

<p>The next thing that came into my life, of any importance, was
meeting my first husband. In the fall of '52 Mr. Gieger had
two brothers come from Michigan and they spent the winter
with him and in the spring went to the mines in Southern Oregon,
then on the northern California, where they mined a while
and then started a store. There were the two Grieger boys and
associated with them were the two Hazlett brothers and Mat
Fultz. Someone was always coming down with pack animals
to get supplies, as they had to be packed out from Portland or
Scotsburg. This summer Everett Gieger[**PP Grieger, Geiger?] came and one of the
Hazletts came with him and spent the summer, returning in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">Thirty-Four</a></span>
fall with supplies. One morning I was sweeping the floor and
was around with the children. About ten or eleven o'clock a
man came to the door. He had long hair down over his shoulders;
he wanted know if this was where Mr. Gieger lived. I was
barefooted and not in trim to see visitors, but the stranger said
"Everett Gieger would be along the next day; that he had stopped
to visit someone and he had come on ahead." They spent the
summer there. During the summer, they made up a party&mdash;Mr.
Gieger and his wife, her sister and myself, and a man by the
name of Mr. Blank, made a trip over to Tillamook Bay. We
went up to the head of the Yamhill valley, that is now the Siletz
Reserve. We crossed the mountains on just a thread of a heavily
timbered trail and were the second party of women that had
crossed the mountains. We were two days going over the mountain
to come down into the valley of Tillamook and on down
to what is known as Traskville. A man by the name of Trask
lived there and made butter and took it to Portland to sell.</p>

<p>Mr. Grieger[**Geiger?] and Mr. Trask were acquainted. We spent
a night and a couple of days there; then went on down and
camped on Tillamook Bay and hired a boat to go down the bay
to the mouth of the river and I had my first glimpse of the
Pacific ocean. That was the first time I ever saw any clams.
The gnats were terrible. We spent a few days near the shore
and then came back to Yamhill and Mrs. Gieger's father's home.
We staid there a few days and then returned to our own home.
In the meantime Mr. Everett Gieger had fallen in love with
Narcissa Cornwall, Mrs. Gieger's sister. I was promised to
marry Mr. Hazlett. The two men went away in October, back
to the mines. In February they were to return and we were to be
married and go back to Illinois to live. But meantime they
changed their minds and concluded they would go into the stock
business in the Little Shasta valley. They took up a farm there
and didn't come down until May. They bought a lot of stock
to drive down, two yokes of oxen and a wagon; the oxen had
worked or been driven across the plains.</p>

<p>Even in these early times, the subject of clothes claimed some
attention of the feminine mind. When I was about thirteen
years old I was very anxious to have a white dress. I had
never had one. Mrs. Smith had kept Joe Gale's four children
during the winter, while the parents went to California to the
mines. He had sent up some white goods, scarfs, shawls and
so on, but I wanted a white dress. Mrs. Smith told me if I
would come down and do four washings she would let me have
everything to make me a dress, so I went to the river to wash
and I got the goods for my dress and when I went to board with
Mrs. Eells, she made the dress with flowing sleeves and three
tucks in the skirt. She made undersleeves, too. The first pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">Thirty-Five</a></span>
of gloves I ever had I bought from a peddler, paying twenty-five
cents for them. I earned most of the money that bought my
wedding outfit. The wedding dress was a white one and I
trimmed my own wedding bonnet. Mr. Gieger bought my shoes,
which were poor leather slippers, with no heels, such as the men
wore. I was very much disappointed in my shoes, for they
were just like old bedroom slippers. I had my hair braided and
wore a big horse-shoe comb. I had white ribbon around my
wrists like a cuff. Abigail Walker, my girl chum, came over
and helped me dress. The wedding day was the fifth of June
and the Rev. Walker performed the ceremony. His family, Mrs.
Eells and family and other friends were there. Mr. Walker
was a very nervous man and when he preached he would shake
like a person with a mild nervous chill. Mrs. Eells said that
she could hardly keep from laughing during the ceremony, Mr.
Walker's clothing shook so. I had the usual congratulations
from the guests and the single men's congratulations was the
privilege of kissing the bride. We had the wedding feast. Mrs.
Walker came over to make the cake. She was the best cake
maker in the neighborhood. She couldn't manage the cake on
our stove as well as on her own, so she carried the batter in a
bucket, four miles on horseback, baked it in her own stove, and
brought back a fine wedding cake with green cedar laid on the
plate and the cake set on that. The trimmings were cedar boughs,
wild roses and honeysuckle.</p>

<p>The next day my husband had to go to Portland on business
and we went as far as Hillsboro, where I visited Mrs. Eells
until he returned. Then we began to get ready to go to my
future home in Shasta valley, traveling with the stock and ox
team. Part of the time I rode horseback and part of the time
I helped drive the cattle. We went on until we got into the
Umpqua valley and it was very warm and the grasshoppers were
eating up the whole country; they had eaten all the foliage on
the trees. We came to the Cow Creek canyon, but the military
road had not been built and we had to travel the old road in
the bed of the creek for miles. It was very rough and rugged
and the hills were steep. We had traveled one day to put up
camp. Next day we started, but in going up a steep hill one of
the oxen stopped and trembled and we thought he had got poisoned.
We cut up some sliced bacon and he didn't object to
eating it and licked his tongue out for more. We gave him some
more bacon and still he wouldn't go. Finally we hired another
team which got us through the canyon, but we concluded it was
only a trick of the old ox, as he had been raised on bacon and
that was all he wanted. We came to the Grave Creek hills
which were very steep. We camped just as we got to the summit
of them and after a rest traveled on; in just two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">Thirty-Six</a></span>
from that time two men were killed in that place by the Indians.
We just missed being killed. We traveled on in the Rogue River
valley which was not very much settled, save in the lower part.
It showed evidence of the conflict between the white men and
the Indians by the lonely graves that were scattered along the
roadside. We came onto Wagner Creek where Mrs. Harris
and other settlers were killed by the Indians in '55. They were
harvesting some fine fields of grain as we came through the
valley. The towns were all small&mdash;they could hardly be seen.
There was Waitsburg, where Mr. Wait had a flouring mill, and a
large log house; and at the time of the Indian trouble, the people
flocked there for safety. In going through the Rogue River
valley the Indians came to our wagon and were very inquisitive
and even got into the wagon and frightened me; and when the
men had to be away I would become very much frightened. One
evening when in camp on the bank of the Rogue River, we saw
across the stream some soldiers who had some Indians with them.
The Indians finally took up their belongings and started across the
mountains. The soldiers crossed the river and the buglar rode
down to our camp and told us it would be better for us to go
up to a nearby farm house; that while he did not apprehend any
trouble, we would be safer there. We went up there and found
seven men, including a fifteen year old boy. They had a log
cabin and very kindly made all the preparation that they could
for our safety. The boy was very anxious to kill an Indian,
so he put seven bullets down in his muzzle-loader gun and said:
"One of those bullets would surely hit an Indian."</p>

<p>So we traveled on to the head of the valley and across the
Siskiyou Mountains into California and we camped over night
on the summit of the mountains. Three weeks afterward, three
teamsters camped there and were killed by the Indians. We
came on down into a rough looking country&mdash;a little mining
camp we called Cottonwood, where my husband had been mining.
We staid there a week, then took our way on south to Willow
Creek in Shasta valley, where my husband had a home for us
to live in and where he was to follow the stock business. We
were there about two months and a half, when the Klamath
Lake Indians began to make trouble. We lived close to their
trail and we were afraid of being killed and so we put up our
belonging and went back to the little mining camp. I never saw the
home again. We lived in this Cottonwood district near the Oregon
line and raised stock, and my husband put out fruit trees
and started raising a garden. In the year '60 he had to be
operated on for cancer. We had to go across the Trinity and
Scott mountains to Red Bluff, where we took the boat down the
Sacramento river. Friends thought he would not live to make the
trip. The doctors said his disease was incurable and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">Thirty-Seven</a></span>
would not live more than three years at best. They operated
on him. I had left our ten-months old baby at home. In the
June before we went down to San Francisco, our house and
belongings were destroyed by fire and we went into a bachelor's
house and lived there.</p>

<p>Many amusing incidents occurred during the long winter
months in the mining districts of northern California, when the
placer miners, waiting for the water to open up, found time
hanging heavy on their hands. Isolated as we were, we welcomed
anything that would break the monotony of life. One
locality in which we lived had always given a Democratic majority
and the Republican brethren of course did not take kindly to
this. One year they determined to beat the Democrats in the
coming election and set about it with considerable vim. As there
were several men in town who did not care particularly which
ticket they voted, they worked on them. I took in the situation
and as all my men folks were Democrats, I decided to have a
little fun and help our party at the same time. I, too, worked on
those who could be influenced to vote either way. One of these
persons was named Davey Crockett and he claimed to be a
nephew of the famous Davey Crockett of "Alamo" fame. This
Crockett was known as "Dirty Crockett," because it well described
his personal appearance. He lived in a "tepee" out in
the hills and hunted deer. He always wore a red cap that had
the corners tied up to look like horns. He said he could always
get the deer, because they would stop to look at his cap long
enough for him to get a bead on them. Another of his accomplishments
was his ability to catch live skunks. He offered to
rid the neighborhood of them if he were paid fifty cents for
each one he brought in alive. He was given the job and soon
came carrying a live skunk by the tail. He said he caught them
by the tail and held them so tight they could not scent him. He
collected his fifty cents from two or three persons. He repeated
this several times; in fact, so frequent became his appearance
with a live skunk that some of the business men became suspicious
and upon investigation it was found that he had caught
just one skunk and whenever he wanted money he would reappear
with the same skunk and collect the bounty. A Welchman,
who was a staunch Republican, offered Crockett a fine
rooster if he would agree to vote that ticket. To this he readily
agreed. When I learned this, I went to him and offered him
two dried mink skins that I had, if he would agree to vote the
Democratic ticket. These looked better than the rooster, so he
transferred his allegiance to the Democratic party. Four or five
"floaters" seen with equally good results kept the balance of
power on the Democratic side on election day.</p>

<p>The Welchman who had labored so hard to make a Republican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">Thirty-Eight</a></span>
of Crockett, gave me a write-up in the paper after
election, telling how the Democrats won the day by the aid of
skunk-catchers and wood-choppers, but little did I care. We
won the day by using his tactics and I had considerable fun with
my experience in early day politics.</p>

<p>The winter of '60-61 being very cold, many cattle died and
this same Crockett made considerable money skinning the dead
animals and selling their hides. One cold and stormy evening,
quite a distance from his home, he skinned a large steer that
had just died and was still warm. As he could not reach home
that night, he rolled himself up in the warm hide. During the
night it froze so hard that it was with considerable difficulty
that he was able to cut himself out in the morning.</p>

<p>An Irishman named Pat O'Halloran was a prospector and
miner, and like most of the early day miners, was fond of a
drink now and then. He would frequently sit around the saloons
watching the card games until a very late hour, or rather, early
morning hour. One dark night he started for home, loaded a
little beyond his capacity. Not being able to keep the road, he
fell into a prospect hole. The hole was about forty feet deep
and Pat went to the bottom. The next morning the ditch-tender
going his rounds, heard someone calling and finally located old
Pat in the bottom of the prospect hole. He went for help. The
men got a windless and bucket and after some effort drew him
near the surface. Now Pat was an uncompromising Democrat,
and as he approached the top he noticed that a preacher, who
was the leading Republican in the neighborhood, was one of his
rescuers. He commanded them to lower him again and "go and
get some Democrats to haul me out," saying "I don't want that
black abolitionist to help me out." So they had to lower him
until they could find Democrats enough to pull him out. We
were eating breakfast when a man came to get my husband to
assist in pulling the Irishman to the surface and he came back
laughing heartily at Pat's political stubbornness. The editor
of the Democratic paper gave him a life subscription to his
paper and Pat lived fifteen years to read it; he then decided he had
enjoyed it long enough and suicided.</p>

<p>We had many interesting neighbors, men and women of
considerable force of character. In the early days of the gold
excitement in southern Oregon and northern California a man
and his wife, by the name of Redfield, located a homestead on
Cow Creek. They built a house and ran a station where travelers
were accommodated with lodging and food. Attacks by
Indians were frequent, but they stayed and fought it out with
them. In one of these attacks, Mrs. Redfield was severely
wounded in the hip, but even this did not dismay them and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">Thirty-Nine</a></span>
staid with their home and continued to fight it out. During
the civil war she was a Union sympathizer and he was equally
strong on the rebel side. Whenever they would get news of a
Union victory, she would give a banquet and invite all their
friends to celebrate; when news of a Rebel victory came, he, in
turn, would give a banquet and call all the friends together.
After the close of the war, he was told that he would not be
allowed to vote and that if he attempted to do so, his vote would
be challenged. He said, "All right"; but on election day he was
at the polls. He had a long muzzle-loading gun and was known
to be a sure shot. He folded his ballot and stuck it in the muzzle
of "old Betsy" and handed it to the clerk, who took it without
protest and no one else challenged his vote.</p>

<p>There was a German citizen named Haserich who was
known as "Slam Bang" among the miners, because of his frequent
use of those words in describing any thing or event. He
was the proprietor of a billiard hall and lodging house. Being
Republican committeeman one year, he called the boys in and
told them that a Mr. Van Dueser, who was the Republican candidate
for the Legislature, was coming to make a speech. Knowing
that the boys were always playing pranks, he implored them
to be "nice" and to listen attentively to what he had to say.
They promised to behave, but when the old man escorted the
speaker into the hall the night of the meeting, there were about
two hundred men there, each with his face blackened and wearing
a high paper collar. The meeting proceeded without disturbance,
but the speaker was not to get away in peace. The
horse he had hired was one that had been trained to stop in
front of every saloon and sit on his haunches. This he did as
usual and the boys had their fun in assuring the dignified speaker
of the evening that his horse wanted a drink before he would
pass the saloon.</p>

<p>In early days, dishes were not very plentiful. Most people
had only tin dishes and these were hard to get. One man, to
avoid the risk of loss, nailed his dishes to the table. When he
wanted to wash them he would turn the table on it's side, take
the broom and some hot water and scrub them well; after
rinsing them, he would turn the table back with the dishes thoroughly
cleansed.</p>

<p>The Rev. Childs (the abolitionist preacher) took a claim with
two young men who were both in their teens and full of pranks.
The Reverend often used to tell them of the fine eels he used
to have in the East, what good eating they were and how he
longed for one again. The boys concluded they would treat him
to one for his dinner some day. One day they caught a rattle
snake and skinned it. As one of them always prepared the
dinner, the snake was cooked and sizzling hot when time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">Forty</a></span>
dinner arrived. The frying pan was put on the table, containing
what the boys said was a nice fat eel. The minister stuck his
fork into a portion and put it on his plate, saying, "This is the
toughest eel I ever saw." The boys were a little dubious about
allowing him to eat it, for fear it might poison him; so one of
them said, "If you had seen the string of rattles on it, you would
have thought it was tough." The preacher took the frying pan
and snake and threw them into the Klamath River.</p>

<p>Ministers were frequently the victims of the rude wit of the
times. One day one drove into town with a team and buggy,
saying he was the Reverend Bullock and that he had been told
there was no church nor anything of a religious nature in the
place; so he had come to try to convert the people and build up
a church. He made an appointment to come and conduct services
in two weeks. He was there, true to his promise, and most
of the people attended the service. When the collection was
taken up, they responded liberally.</p>

<p>In time the people tired of his preaching, so a committee
was appointed to call upon him and tell him that no one cared
to listen to him longer; but he was not to be deterred and when
the regular day for service came, he was on hand again to
preach. The boys decided they would get rid of him for good.
A man by the name of George Horner had collected five hundred
pieces of Chinese money. He went to the store keeper who had
the only safe in town and told him that he had five hundred
dollars which he wanted to deposit in his safe. The old man
took it and put it safely away. On the appointed day for church
services, George had this money distributed among the boys and
they all attended church, well prepared for the collection. The
church was full and the minister's face beamed with delight to
see so large an audience. There were a few men in the place
who had been church members in their Eastern homes. Some
had been exhorters in these churches and when the minister was
fervently praying, outpourings of the spirit, "God grant it" and
"Amens" came from all parts of the church and one could well
imagine that they were in one of the old time Methodist revival
meetings.</p>

<p>The minister seemed to sense that there was something
unusual in the air and hurriedly brought his discourse to a close;
but the boys were determined that the collection must not be
overlooked, so two of them passed the hat among the congregation
and the Chinese money soon filled the hats. The minister
closed without the usual benediction and made for the door,
where the collection was handed to him. When he saw what it
was, he made a hasty retreat to the barn where his team was
and ordered it ready. When he got into the buggy, he found
that some one had not forgotten to put in a few decks of cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">Forty-One</a></span>
and several bottles of whiskey. He drove away and was not
seen again for a number of years.</p>

<p>The town was not to be abandoned by the clergy altogether,
however, so another minister came. It always fell to me to
entertain the traveling ministers and this one was sent to my
house. He told me he saw the need of work in the community
and he thought we should have a church. He asked me what I
thought of the outlook. I told him about the other minister
and his collection and he laughed heartily. He preached that
evening and left the next morning. That ended the religious
effort in our town for a long time.</p>

<p>The ministers did not have all the mishaps, however. A
man named Thomas owned the Eagle grist mall in the Rogue
River valley, Oregon. In 1856 he surveyed and built the toll road
across the Siskiyou mountains. He also owned and operated
a salt works down the Klamath river. On one of his trips
he had in addition to his load of salt a barrel of whisky and a
grindstone. It was late in the evening when he reached the
Klamath ferry and the ferryman told him not to try to cross
Cottonwood creek as it was high and dangerous. The tailings
from the placers formed ridges and holes that were dangerous
in high water. He cautioned him to stay in a house of his close
to the crossing until morning, when it would be safe to cross.
He replied, "I will cross so quick that my salt won't get wet."
Fortunately, he had picked up a traveler on the road and was
giving him a lift to his destination. They attempted the crossing
of the creek and when they overturned in mid-creek this man
succeeded in cutting the horses loose and they all managed to
swim ashore. Then they went on to their camp, returning in
the morning to see what they had left. The wagon and the
grindstone were there buried in the clay, but the salt and whisky
had vanished.</p>

<p>The winter of '62 was very severe and all the stock in the
whole country perished. Mr. Hazlett owned five hundred head
of cattle in the fall and in the spring had about five left. He
had to go back in March to be operated on again for cancer. He
was quite a while in recovering. I went down in June to see him
and he returned with me, but lived only until the next spring.
He left me with five children and I had to build a house to
shelter them. I traded a cow for some lumber and some of my
friends helped me. The house was not finished inside. I used
to take in washing, which was the only thing to be done. Goods
were very high during the Civil war. The orchard had begun
to bear and quite a lot of gooseberries had set on. One year
we had three hundred pounds of them. I managed to care for
my children and in '67 I married Mr. Fultz, my first husband's
partner. We lived there twenty-seven years. I had six daughters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">Forty-Two</a></span>
We at last sold out and came up into Washington to live and
settled in the town of Farmington, going into the hotel business.
Some of my girls were grown and lived with me. We bought a
livery business, then Mr. Fultz started a furniture business and
finally took on undertaking. Mr. Fultz lived but a year after
coming to Farmington and I was left with four businesses on
my hands. All the responsibility rested on me. One daughter
died. With the help of the girls, the house was enlarged to three
stories. After three years one of the girls married, a year after
another, and then another. I had one daughter in California; my
youngest was with me. Six years after Mr. Fultz died I married
Mr. Delaney. We still had the hotel. Then I became crippled
with rheumatism and was given up to die, but finally recovered,
though told I would never walk again. I laid helpless and drawn
up for five months, with life dispared of; but my children came
to me, one from California, one from Lewiston, Idaho, a son and
daughter living in the house and another in town. They all did
everything possible and cared for me continually. My doctor
was faithful and the neighbors were kind to come and do everything
they could for me. The Chinaman cook brewed good
herbs and steamed my limbs and straightened them out and some
of the Coeur d'Alene squaws said they prayed for me. Another
friend furnished me a lot of Medical Lake salts, which he thought
was good for all ailments. After five months I was carried out
in a chair and placed in the sunshine; then came gradually returning
strength and little by little, with the aid of crutches, I walked
and with continual effort and perseverence I at last recovered
the use of my limbs. With my sister, who came to visit me, I
went to visit Perrin Whitman, our old friend.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1843, when Dr. Whitman returned to his
Mission, he brought with him his nephew, Perrin B. Whitman, a
motherless boy of thirteen years. Perrin learned the different
Indian languages very readily and at an early date helped the
Rev. H. H. Spalding to translate the three gospels into the Nez
Perce tongue. He also helped to print them on the first printing
press brought to Oregon. In the month of September, 1847,
he was sent by his uncle to The Dalles to learn the Wascopean
Indian language, as Dr. Whitman had bargained for the Methodist
Station at that place and intended to move his family and
belongings there the following spring. The Doctor also hired a
man named Hindman to go there with his family and take
charge of the place, as he had left most of his supplies at that
point. Four days after the massacre, an Indian came to the
house and told them that another Indian had been at their camp
and told them that Dr. Whitman's wife and all the men at the
Mission had been killed and the other women and children taken
captive. Mr. Hindman was so alarmed for the safety of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">Forty-Three</a></span>
family that he hired an Indian with his canoe to take him to
Fort Vancouver for help. He had not been gone long when four
Cayuse Indians came to the house and wanted Perrin to let them
in. With Perrin was Mrs. Hindman, her fourteen-months-old
baby and a young girl of sixteen years of age named Mary
Warren.</p>

<p>At the approach of the Indians Mrs. Hindman sank into
a chair with her babe in her arms. She was speechless and helpless.
Perrin stood at the door and talked from the inside. He
afterward said that if he ever talked Walla Walla, he did that
day. Miss Warren stood at the other door with uplifted ax
and vowed she would kill the first Indian who attempted to enter.
They tried in every way to induce Perrin to come outside, but
he refused to go. They finally left and Perrin said that Miss
Warren was the bravest woman he ever knew. She never showed
any sign of fear throughout the trying ordeal. He also said
that he was satisfied that the Indians came with the intention
of killing all of them. In a few days Mr. Hindman returned
with help and they moved to Oregon City.</p>

<p>Perrin clerked in Allen McKinley's store during the winter
and in the spring went as interpreter with a company of Volunteers
to seek out and punish the perpetrators of the massacre.
After the Volunteers returned, he married Priscilla Parker, a
daughter of Sam Parker of Salem, Oregon, and took up a farm
near Salem. He and his family lived there until the United
States military authorities went to Fort Lapwai. As they wished
to make a treaty with the Indians, they needed an interpreter.
The Indians refused to talk until they had Whitman to interpret
for them. They were told by the military authorities that they
would write for him, but the Indians said, "No. Send a man
for him." One day as he was ploughing in his fields a man came
and gave him a note, ordering him to come at once to Lapwai
to act as interpreter. (He afterwards told me that "this was
the only time he was ever taken on a bench warrant.") He put
his team in the barn and left at once for Lapwai.</p>

<p>He spent many years among the Nez Perce Indians as
government interpreter, teacher and missionary and no one man
ever exerted such an influence for good over them as Perrin
Whitman. Their confidence in him was unbounded and his
word always accepted as the gospel truth. They knew him and
loved him and would never sign a treaty or take any important
step without his advice.</p>

<p>After an interval of thirty-eight years, during which time
I had not seen him, I journeyed to Lewiston by stage for the
purpose of paying him and his family a visit. The stage driver
was Felix Warren, an old friend of mine. On our way there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">Forty-Four</a></span>
Mr. Warren said, "You must stay with my wife and me tonight,
for I know as soon as Whitman knows you are in town, we will
see no more of you." I said, "Very well." So we went to his
house. We had been there only a short time when a lady came
in. As we were introduced she said, "Why, you are father's
old friend." She went to the door and called her son and told
him to run to Grandpa's and "tell him his friend is here." He
came over on a run and when he looked at me he said, "Matilda,
where did you get your hair dyed?" (My hair had not yet
turned grey.)</p>

<p>I replied, "What is the matter with you, that you don't dye
yours?" His hair and whiskers were almost white. We went
to his house at once. He would not even let me eat supper with
my friends, the Warrens. We talked over old times until two
o'clock in the morning. Next morning early we continued our
reminiscenses. My visit will always be a pleasant memory.</p>

<p>When the Northern Pacific railroad was building across the
Nez Perce reservation the Indians refused to negotiate until
their friend Perrin Whitman was sent for to explain things
to them. Again when the Commissioners called for Volunteers
to go among the different factions to get their consent to the
building of the road, not an Indian offered his services until
the Commissioners said, "Of course, you understand that Whitman
goes along." Then there were plenty of volunteers. They
said of him, "Whitman can ride all day and all night without
sleep and he never talks with a crooked tongue." It was a
severely hard trip in the storm and sleet that comes in the spring
in that country; the roads were rough and the nights cold. Not
long after this experience he was stricken with slow paralysis
and was confined to his bed most of the time for six years before
his death. When Perrin Whitman passed on to his reward, a
civilizing influence that helped to make the great Northwest safe
for the white man went out. He was all that an honest man
should be. As I have said before, sister and I went to visit him
after my long and severe illness. A short time after we reached
there, a long distance message told me that the town had burned
and I had lost everything. Since then I have never been able
to do anything, but have been cared for by my children. They
have looked after me and I have had a good home and the comforts
of life. Once, only, I went back to visit the old California
home. Found a few there whom I had known and received a
hearty welcome; many had passed over the long trail to the better
land. Once I went to Baltimore, Md., to visit my daughter,
and on that trip I came to realize the changes that my lifetime
had experienced. On the vast plains, where years before my
childish eyes had seen vast herds of buffalo roaming at will
and where all was Indian territory from the Missouri river to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">Forty-Five</a></span>
Rocky mountains, where the immigrant's wagon had toiled slowly
and painfully along, with the menace of privation and death a
constant attendant, railroads had thrust their slender bands of
steel; large cities had been built and prosperous farms dotted the
land. Surely a magician must travel with me, constantly waving
a magic wand before my surprised eyes!</p>

<p>On the fiftieth anniversary of the Whitman massacre,
through the courtesy of the O.-W.&nbsp;R. &amp; N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Co., all the
survivors were given transportation to go to the exercises attendant
upon the erection of a monument to the memory of Dr.
Whitman and his fellow martyrs. When the mound was leveled
the workmen, to their surprise, found many bones. These bones
were classified by Dr. Bingham and others. I went to the home
of Dr. Penrose to assist in identifying them. A skeleton of a
foot in a part of a leather boot, we felt sure belonged to Mr.
Kimball, as he was the only man at the Mission who wore
such boots.</p>

<p>The skull of a white woman was, of course, that of Mrs.
Whitman. It showed large eye-sockets. Mrs. Whitman had
large light blue eyes. Dr. Whitman had a strong face, his
massive chin turning up a little. A man's skull showed two
tomahawk cuts. I asked Dr. Penrose to hold the skull, which
was in two parts, together; and as I went back in memory and
imagined the skull clothed with flesh, I felt it was Dr. Whitman's.
Both his and Mrs. Whitman's had been cut in two parts with
a saw&mdash;an old trick of the Indians upon some victims. The
teeth in the skull which I felt was that of Dr. Whitman, were
intact and some of the lower back ones were filled with gold.
Perrin Whitman had told me that when he had gone with the
volunteers to the Mission the spring after the massacre, he had
picked up a skull among others which he then claimed was that of
his uncle. He said he recognized it by the gold fillings in the
back teeth, as when coming West in 1843 he went with his
uncle to a dentist in St. Louis, Mo., and that was the first time
he ever saw gold-leaf, which was used in his uncle's teeth.
It was the first dental work he had ever seen done and he was
very much interested and it made a deep impression upon his
mind. The skull with the unusually large nose orifice, we felt
sure was that of Mr. Hoffman as he was the only man in the
settlement having a very large nose. A very thick skull, we
felt, resembled Mr. Gillam, the tailor. The skull of an old man,
we decided, was that of the miller, Mr. Marsh. The thigh-bone of
a boy about fifteen years of age, we were sure belonged to my
brother, Frank, as he was the youngest killed. It was considered
remarkable that the bones were so well preserved after the lapse
of half a century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">Forty-Six</a></span>In 1916 I attended the reunion of the Oregon Pioneer Society
and that of the Indian Volunteers at Portland. A gathering of
1600 persons gathered in the City Auditorium. It was a most
interesting meeting to me and kept my mind constantly occupied
with past experiences. Perhaps the thing that brought by-gone
times most vividly to my mind was the trip for the pioneers up
the Columbia Highway in autos furnished by the city. As I
looked out across the broad river from the height of the <em>Vista
House</em>, dedicated to the pioneers of Oregon, the beautifully finished
roadway, with its wonderful curves, solid masonry, gentle
grades, faded from before my eyes and again I saw a little party
of forlorn and homeless refugees rowing down that same river
in the old-fashioned, flat-bottomed bateaux, thankful to be alive,
but always hurrying to put more and more miles of water
between them and the tragic place called Waiilatpu. The chill of
those misty winter days again crept to my heart and I clearly
recalled the childish awe that filled my soul as I noticed the girth
and height of the forest trees on either side of the murky, greenish
water that swept on past them with a strong current, leaving
sand-bar after sand-bar a gleam of tawny color against their
masses of dark green foliage; and I thought of a moment when
we saw a little cluster of five log houses and knew that we could
see Portland. Then as I looked toward the magnificent city of
today, with its homes, churches, schools, its parks and business
places, I felt that I must be waking from a <em>Rip Van Winkle</em>
sleep and the magic of the moment almost overcame me. This
thought I carried away with me. Surely if the way of the
pioneer is hard and beset with dangers, at least the long years
bring at last the realization that life, patiently and hopefully
lived, brings its own sense of having been part and parcel of the
onward move to better things&mdash;not for self alone, but for others.</p>
